### Sponsorships
All projects have a number of monthly expenses to keep things running, and Project Trident is no exception. If you wish to help the project pay for things like webserver rentals or email accounts, you can become a sponsor for as little as $1/month via GitHub Sponsors!

### Contributing code or other work
All of the Project Trident sources are available publicly [on GitHub](https://github.com/project-trident) for anybody to submit changes/updates. All it takes is a GitHub account to save your changes, and then submitting them to Project Trident as a Pull Request (PR).

Here are some key repositories where anyone can easily submit changes:

#### Installer
* Repository: [https://github.com/project-trident/trident-installer](https://github.com/project-trident/trident-installer)
