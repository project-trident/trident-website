Project Trident has a strict "no-tracking" policy for our users, and this directly translates over to runtime statistics that the project collects and maintains.

Project Trident does not include any "anonymous reporting" methods that are common in applications. Instead, the only thing that Project Trident tracks is the number of update file downloads from our web servers. This provides basic but useful statistics about the number of systems that are online at any given day or month. This also lets us see the version breakdown that are still running "out in the wild".

{{% notice warning %}}
The stats on this page are only for the FreeBSD-based version of Project Trident, which was discontinued in January of 2020.
The statistics for the Void-Linux based version of Project Trident are still TO-DO.
